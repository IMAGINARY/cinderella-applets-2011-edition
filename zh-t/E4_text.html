<p> 
A moving planet in the gravitational field of many huge masses (suns) also exhibits chaotic behavior.
The following fact is remarkable: If the planet moves in the force field of only <i>one</i> sun, then the resulting behavior is very regular and the well-known (non-chaotic) Kepler ellipses emerge. If there are <i>two</i> suns, then the behavior is much more complex but still not chaotic. It needs at least <i>three</i> suns to create a really chaotic behavior.

Clicking the <i>start</i> button starts the simulation. The <i>trace</i> button allows to follow the paths more closely.
Suns that are moved to the <i>parking area</i> are deactivated.
