The Platonic solids are three-dimensional objects whose faces consist only of regular triangles, quadrangles or pentagons. They are free of self-intersections and at every vertex exactly the same number of polygons (that are all of the same type) meet. It was proven already by Euclid over 2000 years ago, that there are exactly five solids that have these properties.
<br>
In the program on the right you can view these solids and fold/unfold them to a corresponding net of regular polygons.
