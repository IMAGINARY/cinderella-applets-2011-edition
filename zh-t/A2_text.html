<p> 
If one considers <i>real</i> physical mirrors, the mirror images can clearly not overlap each other. Instead, at every position there is exactly one 
mirror image. At the edge where the two mirrors meet some kind of "break line" occurs whenever the angle between the mirrors is not a divisor of  180&deg;.
The simulation an the right again allows to control the angle by moving the slider.

You can select the reflected object by clicking on the small icons 
an the right. The position of the objects can be controlled by moving the
small green points.
