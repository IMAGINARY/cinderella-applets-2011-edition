A nice and simple system that creates a deterministic chaotic behavior is a double pendulum. To an ordinary pendulum another pendulum is attached. The long-term behavior of this system is very sensitive to the initial conditions when the pendulum is released: the lengths, the masses and the exact positions of the pendulums.

In the visualization on the right you can experiment with different starting lengths and positions. Clicking the <i>trace</i> button one can follow the trace of the pendulum more closely. One can also alter the direction and strength of the gravitational force.
