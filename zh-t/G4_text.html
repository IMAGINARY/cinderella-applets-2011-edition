This solitaire game was invented in 1970 by the Japanese Nobuyuki Yoshigahara. Perhaps it is one of the most interesting sliding puzzles.
<br>
<br>
The aim of the game is to release the red racing car. Unfortunately it is blocked by other cars. These cars are again blocked by other cars who are blocked by still other cars. Try to release your car by moving the cars back and forth.

If you would like to try more and harder levels we recommend the game Rush Hour by ThinkFun.
