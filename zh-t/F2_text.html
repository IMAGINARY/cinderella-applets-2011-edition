<p> 
A leaf of a fern looks almost exactly like the fern itself - just smaller.
This observation may be used to create computer generated pictures of ferns (and also of other plants).
<br>
<br>
As in the previous visualization we have a copying machine that can create four smaller copies of an image. However in contrast to the previous applet we here want to create a very fine and granular picture of a fern.
In order to achieve this we start with a single point and now randomly choose one of the copying machines to map the point. The mapped point is drawn and again taken as a starting point for a randomly chosen copying process. The mapped point is drawn again and chosen again as new starting point. This procedure is repeated several million times.
<br>
<br>
The simulation allows to adjust the position of the copy transformations, the colors and the probability distribution for the choice of the specific copying machines.
