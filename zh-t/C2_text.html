<p> 
While Platonic solids are composed of regular <i>n</i>-gons of only one kind, the Archimedean solids admit regular <i>n</i>-gons of different kinds as faces
(here <i>n</i> is some integer 1, 2, 3, 4, &hellip;). In the program on the right you can continuously morph between certain Archimedean solids by moving the white point in the triangle.
<br>
<br>
All together there exist 13 Archimedean solids 11 of which can be reached using this program. The central solid can be rotated by dragging it.
