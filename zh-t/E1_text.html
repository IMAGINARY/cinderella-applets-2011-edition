<i>Deterministic chaos</i> describes a process that strictly follows mathematical or physical rules but is very sensitive to the choice of initial conditions. Small changes in the starting parameters may cause an
unpredictable effect on a long-term scale.
<br>
<br>
A very simple example of such a deterministic yet chaotic system arises when a light ray is reflected between several circular mirrors.

<br>
<br>
The applet on the right simulates such a light ray. The origin and direction of the ray as well as the positions of the circles may be changed by moving the colored points.
<br>
<br>
Possible experiments: What happens if the origin of the light ray is inside one of the circles? What happens if another circle intersects the first one? What happens if the origin of the light ray lies in the intersection of several circles? Try and experiment. It's worth it.
