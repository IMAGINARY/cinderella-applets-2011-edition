<i>確定性混沌</i>意指一套遵守數學或物理原則，但對起始條件非常敏感的系統。起始條件的些微變化會在長期創造出不可預期的影響。 
<br>
<br>
這類混沌的一個簡單例子是，一道光在許多弧狀鏡面間的反射。A very simple example of such a deterministic yet chaotic system arises when a light ray is reflected between several circular mirrors.

<br>
<br>
The applet on the right simulates such a light ray. The origin and direction of the ray as well as the positions of the circles may be changed by moving the colored points.
<br>
<br>
Possible experiments: What happens if the origin of the light ray is inside one of the circles? What happens if another circle intersects the first one? What happens if the origin of the light ray lies in the intersection of several circles? Try and experiment. It's worth it.
