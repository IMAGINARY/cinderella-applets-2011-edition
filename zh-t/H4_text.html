<p> 
Here a swarm simulation is combined with a simulation of genetic inheritance.
In the first screen you see four smileys (two female and two male). These are the ancestors of a whole population of smileys. These smileys have genes (internally these are just numbers) describing the form and position of the mouth, the hair and the eyes. You can adjust the value of these genes using the sliders. Childrens' genes are a combination of the genes of their parents.

Clicking the <i>simulate</i> button starts a simulation. In this simulation males and females are attracted by each other and give birth to children.
Like this a whole population evolves.
