Using the program shown on this page you can freely generate symmetric wallpaper ornaments. By using the sliders you can control the color palette and the behavior of a pen. Using your finger you can draw within the rectangular frame in the middle of the screen. You can choose between different types of symmetry by using the 17 buttons on the lower right of the screen.
<br>
<br>
Mathematical background: If there exist translational symmetries in two different directions there  are (amazingly) only 17 different types of structuraly different symmetry groups that can arise - the so called <i>wallpaper groups</i>. Using the program you can experience all these different groups.
<br>
<br>
Suggestions: How do the same input strokes look in different wallpaper groups? What happens if you connect two different centers of rotational symmetry by a single stroke?
