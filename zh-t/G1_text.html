Sudoku has gained increasing popularity over the past few years.
In a grid of 9 &times; 9 cells the numbers from 1 to 9 have to be written in a way such that in every row and column each digit occurs exactly once. As if this was not enough also in the highlighted 3 &times; 3 blocks each digit must occur exactly once.

In a typical Sudoku puzzle a few numbers are already fixed. The puzzle consists of finding an admissible placement of digits for the empty fields.
The difficulty ranges from <i>childish</i> to <i>hard as hell</i>.
