The amazingly complex looking swarm simulation on the right is created by very simple rules. Each fish recognizes other fish close to him as neighbors. Then it estimates the average position and average speed of these neighbors and adjusts its speed by applying the following rules:
<table>
<tr height=10><td></td><tr>
<tr><td width=20>&nbsp;&#8226;</td><td>
<font size=5>Avoid other fish and obstacles.</font>
</td></tr>
<tr height=10><td></td><tr>
<tr><td>&#8226;</td><td>
<font size=5>Swim towards the position where your </font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>
<font size=5> neighbors are. </font>
</td></tr>
<tr height=10><td></td><tr>
<tr><td>&#8226;</td><td>
<font size=5>Swim in the same direction</font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>
<font size=5>as your neighbors. </font>
</td></tr>
<tr height=10><td></td><tr>
<tr><td>&#8226;</td><td>
<font size=5>Except for that just continue swimming.</font>
</td></tr>
<tr height=10><td></td><tr>
</table>
Using the sliders you can adjust how much the different rules influence speed and direction of a fish. One can also adjust the number of neighbors seen by a fish.
