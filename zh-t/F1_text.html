<p> 
The visualization on the right demonstrates how a repeated copying process of an arbitrary image may generate plant-like structures.
<br>
<br>
Assume you have a sheet of paper showing an arbitrary picture. Feed it to a special copying machine that generates four copies of the picture on a new sheet of paper. These copies may be moved, shrinked and rotated. Now take the resulting picture and copy it again (such that you obtain 16 copies of the original picture). If you proceed in the same way you will create more and more smaller and smaller images.
<br>
<br>
Moving the big slider in the animation on the right illustrates what happens if you do this copying process over and over again. You can also move the position of the copies that are generated by the copying machine.
<br>
<br>
Depending on the exact position of the copies fern like structures will emerge automatically.
