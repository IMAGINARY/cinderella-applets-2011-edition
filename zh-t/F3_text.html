The pattern formed by the seeds in a sunflower head follows remarkable rules. A closer look at such a sunflower head reveals spiral patterns with an amazing packing density.
<br>
<br>
The rule which determines the exact seed positions is surprisingly simple. If you number the seeds consecutively from the center to the periphery then the <i>n</i>-th seed must be placed at an angle of <i>n</i>&middot;137.508&deg; and at a radius of square-root of <i>n</i>.
The angle of 137.508&hellip;deg is with a remarkable precision 360&deg; times the golden ratio 0.618&hellip; squared.
<br>
<br>
If the angle is disturbed ever so slightly the dense packing breaks up and forms prominent spiral arms. The number of these spiral arms turns out to be a number from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &hellip; (here every number is the sum of its two predecessors). In reality sunflowers with exactly 55 or even 89 visible spiral arms are rather common.
