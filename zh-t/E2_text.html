In 1970 the famous mathematician John Conway invented a very simple system in which a very complicated behavior can emerge: the <i>game of life</i>.
<br>
<br>
Inside the cells of a square grid 'beings' will come to life or die. Living or dying exclusively depends on the number of existent neighbors.
In Conway's original variant a new being is born if a cell has exactly 3 living neighbors. It will stay alive if it has 2 or 3 living neighbors.

<br>
<br>
The simulation on the left allows to fill the grid with a random starting configuration. It is also possible to draw self created start configurations using the touch-screen. One can also change the rules of birth and surviving. Clicking <i>start</i> starts the simulation of Conway's game of live.

The colors of the cells indicate the number of living neighbors.
