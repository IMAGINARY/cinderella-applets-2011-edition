<p> 
The solitaire puzzle on the right is solved if after 13 moves there is only one stone left on the board. In each move one picks a stone and lets it jump over another stone which is then to be removed.
<br>
<br>
This is not easy at all. To incite you the picture below shows a few intermediate steps of a solution for a particular starting position.
<br>
<br>
The real 'pros' manage to have the final stone exactly at the position that was empty at the beginning.
