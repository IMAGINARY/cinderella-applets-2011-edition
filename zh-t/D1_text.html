It is possible to fill the three-dimensional space with many cubes.
Surprisingly there are also other solids that can be used to fill the space (without any gaps) only by translates of the same object. Such objects are called space filling polytopes. The program on the right allows to explore five types of such space filling polytopes.

The packing structures generated by these polytopes are relevant not only mathematically. They also form the basis for the spacial positions of atoms in regular crystalline structures.
