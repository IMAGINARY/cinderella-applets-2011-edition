The 14/15-puzzle was invented in 1880 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, an American post office clerk. It was popularized by Sam Loyd, a famous inventor of puzzles. 15 square tiles must be sorted by moving them on a 16 &times; 16 square  grid.

It is an amazing fact that not every arrangement of numbers can be brought into the right order like that. For example if only the plates marked 14 and 15 are swapped it can be proven that it is impossible to sort the tiles completely.
