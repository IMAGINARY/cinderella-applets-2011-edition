<p>
With this program you can create highly symmetric three-dimensional polytopes (solids with flat faces). Starting with a Platonic solid (for instance a cube, or an octahedron) you can apply several operations to obtain polytopes with the same symmetry structure. You can
<br><br>
1. extrude the centers of faces<br>
2. shrink faces<br>
3. move the points on an edge <br> 
<br>
By clicking the magic-wand-button you can declare the current object as a new starter for the next operations. 
<br>
<br>
By using the color wheel and the transparency sider you can alter the graphic appearance of the object.
