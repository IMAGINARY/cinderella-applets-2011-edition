If you combine rotations and scalings the repeated application creates facinating spiral like objects. A simple way to generate such patterns is demonstrated in the program on the right.
<br>
<br>
One starts with an arbitrary quadrilateral with vertices <i>ABCD</i>. Now one
creates a rotated and scaled copy of this quadrilateral such that the edge  <i>CD</i> of the old quadrilateral is identified with the edge  <i>AB</i> of the new quadrilateral. Then one repeats this process iteratively.
<br>
<br>
The visualization on the right demonstrates this process starting with an
arbitrary quadrilateral whose corners can be freely moved.
