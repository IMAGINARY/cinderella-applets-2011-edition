The situation of the previous applet becomes even more exciting if two similarities are iterated instead of just one.
<br>
<br>
Here an initial image is mapped in two different ways by similarities. The resulting two images will be mapped in the same way generating four new images, and so forth. This procedure yields tree-like structures.
<br>
<br>
By moving the points in the program on the right you can change the position of the images and the parameters of the similarity operations. It is possible to change the images by clicking on the thumbnails.
