The atoms in crystalline structures form very regular spacial configurations. They are closely related to the mathematics of space filling polytopes and sphere packings.
<br>
<br>
The program on the right demonstrates several typical instances of such configurations.
By clicking the small cube or octahedron one can observe how these structures fit into the symmetry structure of regular crystals.
