"An object is symmetric if you can somehow manipulate it and in the result 
obtain exactly the same object you started with." 
This very sharp definition of symmetry goes back to the famous mathematician Hermann Weyl (1885-1955). In this sense the picture of a gothic window-rosette shown below possesses a rotational symmetry. After you rotated it by 60&deg; you obtain exactly the original image.

The program on the left allows you to generate various kind of pictures that possess a rotational symmetry. You can change the position of the fruit by simply dragging it.
